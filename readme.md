1) Welcome to the car rental service software CRSS.
2) This software is designed to help a small car rental service business organize and store their data inside mysql database. 
3) CRSS has been only tested inside of visual studios 2019. To start you will need to connect to mysql database and input all the tables    and default insert values provided under the "Resources Files". They are labeled "insert.sql" and "tables.sql", afterwards CRSS will use visual Studios to connect to the databse once you compile and run.
